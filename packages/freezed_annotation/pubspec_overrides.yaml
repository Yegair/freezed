  # There seems to be a regression with Flutter ^3.24.0
  # that causes an error when generating sources using the build_runner
  # after running `flutter pub downgrade` in GitHub actions,
  # because it then installs frontend_server_client: ^3.0.0:
  #  Could not find a command named
  #  "/path/to/flutter/stable-3.24.0-x64/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/snapshots/frontend_server.dart.snapshot".
